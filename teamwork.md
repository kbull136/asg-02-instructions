# Teamwork

## The Teams

I have grouped folks up as described before, respecting the OLPN requests I received prior to the deadline.

These groups have been mixed up a bit - just because you're at the top of the list here doesn't mean that you were one of the first to complete milestone 1.

| Team # | Name | Name | Name | Name |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1      | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 2      | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 3      | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 4      | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 5      | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 6      | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 7      | xxx  | xxx  |      | xxx  |
| 8      | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 9      | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 10     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 11     | xxx  | xxx  | xxx  |      |
| 12     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 13     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 14     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 15     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 16     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 17     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 18     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |
| 19     | xxx  | xxx  |      |      |


I will send out emails to each pair so that they at least know each other's email address to start with.

## What If My Team Explodes?

I hope this doesn't happen, but life, eh?

I expect folks to communicate with each other in order to prevent explosions. Lack of communication is one of the fundamental causes of things going south, in my opinion as both a person who has worked on teams as an instructor who has observed other teams at work.

If something happens that makes one or both team members want to split the team, then I will move folks into different teams, again based on where they first placed in the submission of milestone 1. This is not a perfect solution, naturally...but you _do_ realize there _is_ no perfect solution, right?

If that process causes some kind of ghastly ripple effect, well then I'll just have to use my human brain, a dose of firm kindness, and some chatting to come to a solution - just like rational human beans do.

## A New GitHub Repo

You will be given a new GitHub Classroom "assignment" to accept - this one, unlike your previous one, is a Classroom team assignment. The process to accept it is a bit different than before; you can look at [this video from GitHub Classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxrA3taZdNM&t=59s) to get a feel for the process.

> **If you're the first person in your team to accept the assignment, please use "team-xx", where xx is your team number listed above.**

## Some Thoughts on Teamwork

I know you folks are upper-year types and have likely been around the teamwork bush a bit. Nevertheless, I have a few things to toss at you to maybe help you at least be aware of some issues that you could address openly at the start of your journey with your teammates. Do NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT YOUR TEAM MEMBERS - THAT WAY LIES HEARTACHE, SUFFERING, and DISSOLUTION:

- do the members of your team do most of their coursework during the morning? afternoon? evening? late-late?
- do your team members have jobs? what are their hours like?
- how many courses are they taking? what are those hours like?
- do your team members want to divvy up work, or code together? or a bit of both?
- do your team members' schedules mesh up with yours? if not, how will you work around this?
- are your team members alpha coding wolf types? or do they prefer to be given tasks? And what about **you**?
- what are your strengths? Your team members'? You all should try to gain experience in both design and development...but focusing on the things you're good at is a prudent idea, too
- what mark are you shooting for? Does it match the other members' goals? You both should be honest about this - really honest. Getting an A is gonna take some hours, folks!
- if you plan on doing at least some "code together" work, have you figured out how to do this effectively? will you meet live? or use a tech (I can recommend [VS Code's Live Share extension] https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare
- read [this brief pdf](hitchikers1.pdf) (it's actually a very short and easy read!) on "hitchhikers" and "couch potatoes"
